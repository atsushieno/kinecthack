This repository is to store my experimental hacks wrt kinect.

It premises 5.1ch surrounded audio.

See index.html for which components are used.

[Setup]

Get audio samples or replace refs in alwalk.js (startSoundLoop()).
They are available in WebAL sample 5.

[Build]

dmcs kinect-listener.cs -r:OpenNI.net.dll -unsafe

[Run]

node server.js (for web/tcp)
mono kinect-listener.exe

Then open http://localhost:8080

Ignore the 3D view obstacles. They do nothing (yet).

Walk around in front of kinect.
